  phrases:
  - In the far, far future, in the year ****, mankind became extinct. From what,
    you ask me? Degradation. Humans were replaced by chimpanzees as the most intelligent
    species.
  - We settled in pretty well, you know. Explored most of the Earth, even learned
    some sciences.
  - So my story slowly moves on to our main character, a chimpanzee named Dopfit.
